# CQInmanis-BTCFarmCustomization-0.1.0
Simple mod for Altered Escape (12.9 2.1.0 for now. 12.12 needs testing) that allows the user to have more control over the game's bitcoin farm.

## Features 
* Bitcoin production timer: controls the base amount of time (before GPUs) 1 physical bitcoin takes to be produced.
* Maximum amount of bitcoins produced: sets how many bitcoins your farm can produce before you retrieve them.

## Possible coming features
* Customization to the number of maximum GPUs running (idk why would you want this having the timer config, but just in case)
* BTC Farm upgrade requirements customization (maybe a multiplier for the required materials)
* Please suggest something on Discord (CQInmanis#4068)

## Installation & Usage
* Stop the server
* Extract files inside your mod directory
* Use a text editor (like Notepad++) and customize options inside config.js
* REMEMBER TO LEAVE YOUR GENERATOR ON WHEN YOU EXIT THE GAME!
